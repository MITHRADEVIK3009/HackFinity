# Secure Civic Survey Platform with AI-Based Fraudulent Data Detection

## 1. Overview

The Secure Civic Survey Platform is a web-based solution designed to collect, verify, and analyze public survey data in the civic governance domain. The platform employs AI/ML-driven anomaly detection to identify fraudulent or manipulated submissions in real-time, ensuring transparency, accountability, and improved public service delivery.

This system is particularly beneficial for semi-urban and rural communities, offering multilingual, voice-first interactions and multiple access channels to increase participation and trust.

## 2. Problem Statement

Citizens in semi-urban and rural regions often face barriers in accessing governance services. Additionally, civic survey data—used for rankings and policy-making—is susceptible to manipulation, leading to reduced credibility and poor service outcomes.  
The platform addresses these issues by combining secure data collection with advanced fraud detection mechanisms.
